    "### Scenario Description: Open Banking\n",
    "\n",
    "Open banking is a practice of enabling data sharing between financial institutions. This practice came to allow banking interoperability by APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). For example, the data subject can request a credit card from bank A, a financial loan from bank B, and buy assets from bank C. Moreover, open banking allows, for instance, the data subject to open an account just requesting his/her data from an institution that he/she has an account previously. Therefore, open banking turns the data sharing more agile, transparent, and secure, for providing resources to the data subject chose: (i) which the data which he/she wants to share; (ii) when; (iii) how long, and (iv) with whom he/she wants to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, open banking acts as a kind of data portability foreseen in the LGPD. However, there are strict rules set by the Central Bank to enable the data exchange between the financial institutions.\n",
    "For instance, the consent term related to open banking must not be provided by paper or an adhesion contract, by forms with agree option filled by default; or without an explicit will of acceptance from the data subject.\n",
    "<!--https://economia.uol.com.br/faq/open-banking-compartilhamento-dados.htm-->\n",
    "\n",
    "A data subject that wants to participate in the open banking ecosystem, he/she has to agree with a consent term that allows the institution to share his/her data. Following the LGPD and the GDPR rules, the institution must offer to the data subject an option to revoke his/her consent anytime. Moreover, particularly in the LGPD, such consent term must be valid by 12 months at most, i.e., the institution must request a new consent term every year to confirm the data subject's wills.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an extensive list of: (i) personal data, (ii) enterprise data, and (iii) transactional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Personal Data: Full Name, Document ID, Residential Address, Phone Number, E-mail Addresses, Social Name,  Parents' Names, Marriage Status, Born date, Gender, Nationality, Income, Patrimony, Occupation, Relationship Start Date, Products and Services Hired, Agency and Account Number, Legal Person in Charge Name and Id Number (if exists).\n",
    " \n",
    "(ii) Enterprise Data: Company's Name, Identification Number, Address, Latitude and Longitude, Phone Number, E-mail Addresses, Owners' Names and their Identification Numbers, Administrators, Society Rates, Start Date, Activity Field, Income, Patrimony, Relationship Start Date, Products and Services Hired, Agency and Account Number.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Transactional Data: Account Balance, Credit Card Type and Identification, Limit, Transactions, Credit Card Bill, Credit Services (Ex: loan and investments)\n",
    "\n",
    "To share the above data, the data subject must agree with the proposed consent term. The process of using the open finance service is free of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, picture that the data subject wants to share his/her data from Bank A to Bank B.\n",
    "The process to share the financial data is composed of six steps as follows:\n",
    " 1. The data subject should start the process showing Bank B his/her intention to get his/her data from Bank A.\n",
    " 2. The data subject should verify the purpose of the data usage from Bank B and go to the next step if he/she has no objection to the informed purpose.\n",
    " 3. The data subject should choose: (i) the origin institution, i.e., Bank A, to request the data, (ii) the data that he/she wants to share, and (iii) the time frame, that must be twelve months at most.\n",
    " 4. Bank B will redirect the data subject to Bank A where the data subject will be able to confirm his/her identity as well as confirm his/her wishes to share the selected data.\n",
    " 5. Bank A will redirect the data subject to Bank B. Bank B will notify the data subject if the authorization process is concluded.\n",
    " 6. Finally, Bank B will be able to request the authorized data from Bank A.\n",
    " \n",
    "It is important to note that the data subject can revoke his/her consent at any time. To do so, the data subject should access Bank A communication channels and request the consent revocation. The data sharing will be stopped in twelve months automatically. In this case, the data subject will be able to choose to renew his/her consent to continue sharing his/her data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consent revocation may imply stopping receiving services and product offers from Bank B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In joint account cases, the authorization can be done individually. The transactional data will be available to anyone who can manage the Bank B account without the others.\n",
    "If there is a requirement to request authorization from more than one account, both banks must provide information regarding how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shared data will be used to offer products and services that fit with the data subject's profile or comply with other legal bases and legal obligations, such as laundry money, fraud, and risk evaluation, including credit risk. Moreover, the data will be used to create and improve the Bank B services, products, and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reproduce the scenario in the Open Banking environment, the first step is to build the consent term with all params foreseen in the LGPD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Subject John wants to share his data from Bank A to Bank B.\n",
    "For the record, let's consider that there is an active consent term between John and Bank A.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the LGPD perspective, the data will be shared for twelve months at most; therefore, from Wednesday, December 08, 2021, 10:41 a.m. to Thursday, December 08, 2022, 10:41 a.m. Bank B will be allowed to get John's data from Bank A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank B will share only the data allowed by John, and will use them to comply with government laws and propose new products and services according to John's profile. Bank B will not share any information with third parties without contacting John. If Bank B updates its consent term, Bank B must inform John regarding this update and request a new approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices based on the user experience with two financial institutions using Open Banking:\n",
    " - Bank A should allow John to select which data he wants to share with bank B.\n",
    " - Bank A should allow John to set the time range that he wants to share his data, considering a maximum of twelve months.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, John followed the six steps mentioned above, and he agreed to share his personal, financial, and transactional data with Bank B. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agents\n",
    " - Data Subject - John\n",
    " - Data Controller and processor - Bank A - Origin\n",
    " - Data Controller and processor - Bank B - Receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "Action\n",
    " - Defined in the consent term.\n",
    " - Risk: the data subjects should evaluate what they consider as low, medium, or high risk. For instance, they may consider the following definitions to guide their decision:\n",
    "   - Low: when there is no sensitive data requisition; \n",
    "   - Medium: there are no sensitive data foreseen in the LGPD, but there are data that may generate discrimination actions to the data subject; \n",
    "   - High: At least one sensitive data foreseen in the LGPD shared with the data controller.\n",
    " - Jurisdiction: Brazilian Law\n",
    " \n",
    "Consent Term\n",
    " - As the scenario description has all the required information for a consent term, it will be considered as the consent term on this occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rights\n",
    " - The Data Subject will have all the LGPD foreseen rights. \n",
    " - Bank A: The consent revocation regarding open banking:\n",
    "     - should not impact the other rights;\n",
    "     - it will imply stopping receiving products and services from Bank B, and the data will not be shared anymore;\n",
    "     - there is no information in the open banking regarding if the data must be deleted from Bank B in this case.\n",
    " \n",
    "Deontic Operator\n",
    " - The Data Subject has the permission to call for any action related to his rights\n",
    " - Data Controller B is obligated to abide by the Data Subject solicitations, except when the law says the opposite.\n",
    " Data Controller B is prohibited from using the personal data collected under the circumstances other than those in the consent term.\n",
    " - Violation and compliance will be explored in the extended scenarios at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Data Subject decided to revoke his consent with Bank B.\n",
    "The following figure depicts this macro scenario process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Scenario2_Process](./img/Scenario2_Process.png \"Process 2\")\n",
    "Fig.5 - Macro Scenario Process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, other four cause-effect scenarios were explored in order to show some possibilities regarding the data subject's rights. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a scenario with Prolog to explore the facts in the different time range and some cause-effect scenarios. This notebook tries to keep general facts that could occur in any domain. Specific domain facts were not explored.\n",

Furthermore, fines can be applied depending on the delay, but they should be evaluated case-by-case.\n",
